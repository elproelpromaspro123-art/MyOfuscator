Implemented Vercel Speed Insights for Next.js as requested.

Project Information:
- Framework: Next.js 14.2.28 (supports App Router)
- Package Manager: npm
- Router Type: App Router (using app/layout.tsx)

Changes Made:

1. **Installed Package**:
   - Added `@vercel/speed-insights` package (version ^1.3.1)
   - Updated package-lock.json with dependency lock information

2. **Modified Files**:
   - web/app/layout.tsx: 
     - Added import: `import { SpeedInsights } from '@vercel/speed-insights/next'`
     - Added component: `<SpeedInsights />` inside the body tag after {children}

Why These Changes:
- Since the project uses Next.js 14.2.28 with App Router (Next.js 13.5+), we used the '@vercel/speed-insights/next' import
- The SpeedInsights component was placed inside the body tag after {children} as recommended for App Router
- No need for 'use client' directive as SpeedInsights handles client-side rendering internally in Next.js

Verification:
- ✓ Build completed successfully with no errors
- ✓ All dependencies installed and locked
- ✓ TypeScript compilation successful
- ✓ Production build generated (4 static pages)

The Speed Insights component is now active and will collect anonymous performance metrics for the Prometheus Obfuscator web interface.
