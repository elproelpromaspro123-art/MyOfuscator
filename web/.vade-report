Implemented Vercel Web Analytics for Next.js

PROJECT: Prometheus Obfuscator Web Interface
REPOSITORY: elproelpromaspro123-art/MyOfuscator
BRANCH: master

COMPLETED TASKS:

1. ✅ Explored codebase and identified router type
   - Project uses App Router (app/ directory structure)
   - Located root layout file at web/app/layout.tsx

2. ✅ Identified package manager
   - Project uses npm (package-lock.json present)
   - Node version requirement: >=18.0.0

3. ✅ Installed @vercel/analytics package
   - Command: npm install @vercel/analytics
   - Version installed: ^1.6.1
   - Added 114 packages successfully

4. ✅ Added Analytics component to root layout
   - File modified: web/app/layout.tsx
   - Import added: import { Analytics } from '@vercel/analytics/next'
   - Component placed inside <body> tag, after {children}
   - This ensures analytics tracking across the entire application

5. ✅ Verified build completes successfully
   - Executed: npm run build
   - Result: ✓ Compiled successfully
   - No build errors or warnings
   - All pages generated correctly

6. ✅ TypeScript type checking
   - Executed: npx tsc --noEmit
   - Result: No TypeScript errors
   - Code is type-safe and compatible with existing codebase

FILES MODIFIED:

1. web/package.json
   - Added "@vercel/analytics": "^1.6.1" to dependencies

2. web/package-lock.json
   - Updated with new dependency and transitive dependencies

3. web/app/layout.tsx
   - Added import for Analytics component from @vercel/analytics/next
   - Added <Analytics /> component inside body, after children
   - Preserved all existing code structure and functionality

IMPLEMENTATION NOTES:

- The Analytics component is properly placed in the root layout, which ensures it tracks all pages in the application
- The component is placed after {children} to ensure page content renders first
- The import follows Next.js best practices for App Router projects
- No breaking changes or modifications to existing functionality
- Build artifacts (.next/, *.tsbuildinfo) are excluded from staging
- Lock files (package-lock.json) are included as package.json was modified

VERIFICATION:

✓ Build completed successfully
✓ No TypeScript errors
✓ Code compiles without warnings
✓ Existing functionality preserved
✓ Import statement is correct for @vercel/analytics/next
✓ Analytics component properly positioned in layout
